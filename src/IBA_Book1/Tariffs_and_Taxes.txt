In 1913, Congress passed the first income tax. The law put into effect the tax that had been authorized by the Sixteenth Amendment. However, the new tax measure was actually not the main focus of congressional attention. The tax measure was just a part of another new law--a major overhaul of the nation's tariff system. The Underwood-Simmons Tariff Act of 1913 was the result of decades of efforts by Democratic party leaders to cut the tariff. The act cut tariffs on nearly 1,000 goods. Progressive Democrats liked the law because tariffs were lifted on most food and clothing--essential items for Americans struggling to make ends meet. The new law meant that consumer goods would be cheaper. The new tariff measure cut the tariffs from 40% to 29%. The new tariffs had a disadvantage, however. The cuts reduced federal income from customs duties by $100 million. How would this money be replaced? That is where the income tax came in. The first federal income tax was added to Underwood's tariff bill to provide a new source of revenue for the government. The tax applied only to income over $3,000 per year ($4,000 for married couples). As people earned more, the tax rate went up. The higher the income, the higher the rate. The rate went from 1% up to a maximum of 7%. Progressives liked this idea because it seemed fair to poor people. The tax applied not only to individual income but also to corporate income. This way the Progressives could tap into the mounting profits of the country's growing businesses. As the graph shows, between 1911 and 1920, the share of federal income from taxes grew larger and larger. Meanwhile-as the backers of the new tariff law expected-the share of tariff revenues dropped sharply.
