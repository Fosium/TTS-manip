According to the theory of mercantilism, governments wanted to add gold and silver to their treasuries. To get that gold and silver, they 'hoped to export goods to other countries that were worth more than the products they imported. The other countries would then have to pay them the difference in gold or silver. Colonies played an important role under mercantilism for several reasons. Colonies were supposed to produce crops that companies in the home country could sell for a profit. They were expected to provide raw materials that could be used by manufacturing companies in the home country. For example, the numerous forests in North America provided lumber for England, which had fewer trees. The colonies also were supposed to provide markets for items manufactured in the home country. In some cases, colonies could provide the home country with gold and silver. For example, Spain established colonies in Mexico and South America because of the gold and silver in those areas. These were some of the reasons that colonies were desirable in theory. In actual practice, colonies had both benefits and costs. These advantages and disadvantages are shown in the chart below.
