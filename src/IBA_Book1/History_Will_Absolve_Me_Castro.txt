Fidel Castro made his entrance into history at dawn on July 26, 1953, when he led a tiny fane of Cuban patriots, one
hundred sixty-five men and two women, in an assault on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba. The quixotic
adventure ended in disaster. Nearly half the rebels were killed, many being tortured to death after capture. Those who
survived were imprisoned. At his trial the twenty-seven-year-old Castro, a lawyer by profession and the son of a large
landowner, made a five-hour defense speech in which he outlined the aims of the uprising. In a general way his speech
offers a blueprint of the radical reform program that the Cuban Revolution was to implement, but the whole document
bears the stamp of a democratic, romantic ideology that Castro would later abandon in favor of Marxism-Leninism. The
title of this selection is taken from the final phrase of Castro's speech: "Condemn me. History will absolve me."

As soon as Santiago de Cuba was in our hands, we
would immediately have readied the people for war.
Bayamo was attacked precisely to situate our advance
forces along the Cauto River. Never forget that this
province, which has a million and a half inhabitants
today, provides without a doubt the best resistance and
the most patriotic men of Cuba. It was this province
that continued the fight for independence for thirty
years and paid the highest tribute in blood, sacrifice,
and heroism. In Oriente, you can still breathe the air of
that glorious epoch. At dawn, when the cocks crow as
if they were bugles calling soldiers to reveille, and
when the sun rises, radiant, over the rugged mountains,
it seems that once again we will hear the cry of Yara or
Baire.
I stated that the second consideration on which we
based our chances for success was one of social order
because we were assured of the people's support.
When we speak of the people we do not mean the
comfortable ones, the conservative elements of the
nation, who welcome any regime of oppression, any
dictatorship, and despotism, prostrating themselves
before the master of the moment until they grind their
foreheads into the ground. When we speak of struggle,
the people means the vast unredeemed masses, to
whom all make promises and whom all deceive; we
mean the people who yearn for a better, more dignified
and more just nation; who are moved by ancestral
aspirations of justice, for they have suffered injustice
and mockery, generation after generation; who long for
great and wise changes in all aspects of their life;
people, who, to attain these changes, are ready to give
even the very last breath of their lives-when they
believe in something or in someone, especially when
they believe in themselves. In stating a purpose, the
first condition of sincerity and good faith, is to do
precisely what nobody ever does, that is, to speak with
absolute clarity, without fear. The demagogues and
professional politicians who manage to perform the
miracle of being right in everything and in pleasing
everyone, are, of necessity, deceiving everyone about
everything. The revolutionaries must proclaim their
ideas courageously, define their principles and express
their intentions so that no one is deceived, neither
friend nor foe.
The people we counted on in our struggle were
these:
Seven hundred thousand Cubans without work, who
desire to earn their daily bread honestly without having
to emigrate in search of livelihood.
Five hundred thousand farm laborers inhabiting
miserable shacks, who work four months of the year
and starve for the rest of the year, sharing their misery
with their children, who have not an inch of land to
cultivate, and whose existence inspires compassion in
any heart not made of stone.
Four hundred thousand industrial laborers and
stevedores whose retirement funds have been
embezzled, whose benefits are being taken away,
whose homes are wretched quarters, whose salaries
pass from the hands of the boss to those of the usurer,
whose future is a pay reduction and dismissal, whose
life is eternal work and whose only rest is in the tomb.
One hundred thousand small farmers who live and
die working on land that is not theirs, looking at it with
sadness as Moses did the promised land, to die without
possessing it; who, like feudal serfs, have to pay for
the use of their parcel of land by giving up a portion of
their products; who cannot love it, improve it, beautify
it or plant a lemon or an orange tree on it, because they
never know when a sheriff will come with the rural
guard to evict them from it.
Thirty thousand small business men weighted down
by debts, ruined by the crisis and harangued by a
plague of filibusters and venal officials.
Ten thousand young professionals: doctors,
engineers, lawyers, veterinarians, school teachers,
dentists, pharmacists, newspapermen, painters,
sculptors, etc., who come forth from school with their
degrees, anxious to work and full of hope, only to find
themselves at a dead end with all doors closed, and
where no ear hears their clamor or supplication.
These are the people, the ones who know misfortune
and, therefore, are capable of fighting with limitless
courage!
To the people whose desperate roads through life
have been paved with the brick of betrayals and false
promises, we were not going to say: "we will
eventually give you what you need, but rather - Here
you have it, fight for it with all your might so that
liberty and happiness may be yours!"
In the brief of this cause there must be recorded the
five revolutionary laws that would have been
proclaimed immediately after the capture of the
Moncada barracks and would have been broadcast to
the nation by radio. It is possible that Colonel
Chaviano may deliberately have destroyed these
documents, but even if he has done so, I conserve them
in my memory.
The First Revolutionary Law would have returned
power to the people and proclaimed the Constitution of
1940 the supreme Law of the land, until such time as
the people should decide to modify or change it. And,
in order to effect its implementation and punish those
who had violated it-there being no organization for
holding elections to accomplish this-the revolutionary
560
movement, as the momentous incarnation of this
sovereignty, the only source of legitimate power,
would have assumed all the faculties inherent to it,
except that of modeling the Constitution itself: In other
words it would have assumed the legislative, executive
and judicial powers.
This approach could not be more crystal clear nor
more free of vacillation and sterile charlatanry. A
government acclaimed by the mass of rebel people
would be vested with every power, everything
necessary in order to proceed with the effective
implementation of the popular will and true justice.
From that moment, the Judicial Power, which since
March 10th has placed itself against the Constitution
and outside the Constitution, would cease to exist and
we would proceed to its immediate and total reform
before it would again assume the power granted to it
by the Supreme Law of the Republic. Without our first
taking those previous measures, a return to legality by
putting the custody of the courts back into the hands
that have crippled the system so dishonorably would
constitute a fraud, a deceit, and one more betrayal.
The Second Revolutionary Law would have granted
property, not mortgageable and not transferable, to all
planters, sub-planters, lessees, partners and squatters
who hold parcels of five or less "caballerias" of land,
and the state would indemnify the former owners on
the basis of the rental which they would have received
for these parcels over a period of ten years.
The Third Revolutionary Law would have granted
workers and employees the right to share 30% of the
profits of all the large industrial, mercantile and
mining enterprises, including the sugar mills. The
strictly agricultural enterprises would be exempt in
consideration of other agrarian laws which would have
been implemented.
The Fourth Revolutionary Law would have granted
all planters the right to share 55% of the sugar
production and a minimum quota of forty thousand
"arrobas" for all small planters who have been
established for three or more years.
The Fifth Revolutionary Law would have ordered
the confiscation of all holdings and ill-gotten gains of
those who had committed frauds during previous
regimes, as well as the holdings and ill-gotten gains of
all their legatees and heirs. To implement this, special
courts with full powers would gain access to all
records of all corporations registered or operating in
this country (in order) to investigate concealed funds
of illegal origin, and to request that foreign
governments extradite persons and attach holdings
(rightfully belonging to the Cuban people). Half of the
property recovered would be used to subsidize
retirement funds for workers and the other half would
be used for hospitals, asylums and charitable
organizations.
Furthermore, it was to be declared that the Cuban
policy in the Americas would be one of close solidarity
with the democratic people of this continent, and that
those politically persecuted by bloody tyrants
oppressing our sister nations would find generous
asylum, brotherhood, and bread in the land of Marti.
Not the persecution, hunger and treason that they find
today. Cuba should be the bulwark of liberty and not a
shameful link in the chain of despotism.
These laws would have been proclaimed
immediately, as soon as the upheaval was ended and
prior to a detailed and far-reaching study, they would
have been followed by another series of laws and
fundamental measures, such as, the Agrarian Reform,
Integral Reform in Education, nationalization of the
Utilities Trust and the Telephone Trust, refund to the
people of the illegal excessive rates this company has
charged, and payment to the Treasury of all taxes
brazenly evaded in the past.
All these laws and others would be inspired in the
exact fulfillment of two essential articles of our
Constitution. One of these orders the outlawing of
feudal estates by indicating the maximum area of land
any person or entity can possess for each type of
agricultural enterprise, by adopting measures which
would tend to revert the land to the Cubans. The other
categorically orders the State to use all means at its
disposal to provide employment to all those who lack
it and to insure a decent livelihood to each manual
laborer or intellectual.
None of these articles may be called
unconstitutional. The first popularly elected
government would have to respect these laws, not only
because of moral obligation to the nation, but because
when people achieve something they have yearned for
throughout generations, no force in the world is
capable of taking it away again.
The problems concerning land, the problem of
industrialization, the problem of housing, the problem
of unemployment, the problem of education and the
problem of the health of the people; these are the six
problems we would take immediate steps to resolve,
along with the restoration of public liberties and
political democracy.
Perhaps this exposition appears cold and theoretical
if one does not know the shocking and tragic
conditions of the country with regard to these six
problems, to say nothing of the most humiliating
political oppression.
Eighty-five percent of the small farmers in Cuba pay
rent and live under the constant threat of being
dispossessed from the land that they cultivate. More
than half the best cultivated land belongs to foreigners.
In Oriente, the largest province, the lands of the United
Fruit Company and West Indian Company join the
north coast to the southern one. There are two hundred
thousand peasant families who do not have a single
acre of land to cultivate to provide food for their
starving children. On the other hand, nearly three
hundred thousand "caballerias" of productive land
owned by powerful interests remain uncultivated.
Cuba is above all an agricultural state. Its population
is largely rural. The city depends on these rural areas.
The rural people won the Independence. The greatness
and prosperity of our country depends on a healthy and
vigorous rural population that loves the land and
knows how to cultivate it, within the framework of a
state that protects and guides them. Considering all
this, how can the present state of affairs be tolerated
any longer?
561
With the exception of a few food, lumber and textile
industries, Cuba continues to be a producer of raw
materials. We export sugar to import candy, we export
hides to import shoes, we export iron to import plows.
Everybody agrees that the need to industrialize the
country is urgent, that we need steel industries, paper
and chemical industries; that we must improve cattle
and grain products, the technique and the processing in
our food industry, in order to balance the ruinous
competition of the Europeans in cheese products,
condensed milk, liquors and oil, and that of the
Americans in canned goods; that we need merchant
ships; that tourism should be an enormous source of
revenue. But the capitalists insist that the workers
remain under a Claudian yoke; the State folds its arms
and industrialization can wait for the Greek calends.
Just as serious or even worse is the housing problem.
There are two hundred thousand huts and hovels in
Cuba; four hundred thousand families in the country
and in the cities live cramped into barracks and
tenements without even the minimum sanitary
requirements; two million two hundred thousand of
our urban population pay rents which absorb between
one fifth and one third of their income; and two million
eight hundred thousand of our rural and suburban
population lack electricity. If the State proposes
lowering rents, landlords threaten to freeze all
construction; if the State does not interfere,
construction goes on so long as the landlords get high
rents, otherwise, they would not lay a single brick even
though the rest of the population should have to live
exposed to the elements. The utilities monopoly is no
better; they extend lines as far as it is profitable and
beyond that point, they don't care if the people have to
live in darkness for the rest of their lives. The State
folds its arms and the people have neither homes nor
electricity.
Our educational system is perfectly compatible with
the rest of our national situation. Where the guajiro4 is
not the owner of his land, what need is there for
agricultural schools? Where there are no industries
what need is there for technical or industrial schools?
Everything falls within the same absurd logic: there is
neither one thing nor the other. In any small European
country there are more than 200 technical and
industrial arts schools; in Cuba, there are only six such
schools, and the boys graduate without having
anywhere to use their skills. The little rural schools are
attended by only half the school-age children-barefoot,
half naked and undernourished-and frequently the
teacher must buy necessary materials from his own
salary. Is this the way to make a nation great?
Only death can liberate one from so much misery. In
this, however-early death-the state is most helpful.
Ninety percent of rural children are consumed by
parasites which filter through their bare feet from the
earth. Society is moved to compassion upon hearing of
the kidnapping or murder of one child, but they are
criminally indifferent to the mass murder of so many
thousands of children who die every year from lack of
facilities, agonizing with pain. Their innocent eyesdeath already shining in them-seem to look into
infinity as if entreating forgiveness for human
selfishness, as if asking God to stay his wrath. When
the head of a family works only four months a year,
with what can he purchase clothing and medicine for
his children? They will grow up with rickets, with not
a single good tooth in their mouths by the time they
reach thirty; they will have heard ten million speeches
and will finally die of misery and deception. Public
hospitals, which are always full, accept only patients
recommended by some powerful politician, who, in
turn, demands the electoral votes of the unfortunate
one and his family so that Cuba may continue forever
the same or worse.
With this background, is it not understandable that
from May to December over a million persons lost
their jobs, and that Cuba, with a population of five and
a half million, has a greater percentage of unemployed
than France or Italy with a population of forty million
each?
When you judge a defendant for robbery, Your
Honors, do you ask him how long he has been
unemployed? Do you ask him how many children he
has, which days of the week he ate and which he
didn't, do you concern yourselves with his
environment at all? You send him to jail without
further thought. But those who burn warehouses and
stores to collect insurance do not go to jail, even
though a few human beings should have happened to
(be cremated with the property insured). The insured
have money to hire lawyers and bribe judges. You jail
the poor wretch who steals because he is hungry; but
none of the hundreds who steal from the Government
have ever spent a night in jail; you dine with them at
the end of the year in some elegant place and they
enjoy your respect.
In Cuba when a bureaucrat becomes a millionaire
overnight and enters the fraternity of the rich, he could
very well be greeted with the words of that opulent
Balzac character, Taillefer, who, in his toast to the
young heir to an enormous fortune, said: "Gentlemen,
let us drink to the power of gold! Mr. Valentine, a
millionaire six times over, has just ascended the
throne. He is king, can do everything, is above
everything-like all the rich. Henceforward, equality
before the law, before the Constitution, will be a myth
for him; for he will not be subject to laws, the laws
will be subject to him. There are no courts or sentences
for millionaires."
The future of the country and the solution of its
problems cannot continue to depend on the selfish
interests of a dozen financiers, nor on the cold
calculations of profits that ten or twelve magnates
draw up in their air-conditioned offices. The country
cannot continue begging on its knees for miracles from
a few golden calves, similar to the Biblical one
destroyed by the fury of a prophet. Golden calves
cannot perform miracles of any kind. The problems of
the Republic can be solved only if we dedicate
ourselves to fight for that Republic with the same
energy, honesty and patriotism our liberators had when
they created it.
