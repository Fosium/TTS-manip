As we look at today's world, we can make the mistake of thinking that the global division of poor countries and rich countries, powerful and powerless, has always been with us. To begin to grasp the causes of this inequality, we need to travel back at least as far as Columbus, to the origins of European colonialism. As Marge Piercy writes in her poem, "Contribution to Our Museum" (see opposite), "The past leads to us if we force it to." History matters. We open this chapter with quotes from eyewitness observers who describe the Brazil of the early 1500s as "a lush land" of strong, well-fed people existing "on a succulent diet of exotic fruits, herbs, game, and an infinity of fish" â€“ a land that must be "near the terrestrial paradise." Not quite 500 years later, eyewitnesses describe the same territory as polluted and malnourished - "one of the poorest areas in the world." Why this change? Sandwiched in between these contrasting social portraits is a story of invasion and colonialism - one that differs depending on the society, but which, from Kenya to India to Brazil, shares certain features. This chapter includes readings and activities to acquaint students with some of the dynamics of European colonialism. Part of rethinking globalization entails searching for continuities that connect past to present. What connections can students find, for example, between the cash crop demands of European colonialists and the "structural adjustment" demands of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank? Students may find that, in important respects, globalization is a new name for an old game.
