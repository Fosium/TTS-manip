In the 1870s, American farmers became more efficient and produced more food than ever. But much to their disappointment, they didn't make any more money because food prices fell. They were seeing firsthand the economic law of supply arid demand. In free markets, without government controls, supply and demand work together to set prices. According to the law of supply, producers are willing to produce more of a good if the price is higher. That's because they will make more money from selling the good. They want to produce less of the good if the price is lower. Consumer demand works in the opposite way. Consumers are willing to buy more of a good if the price is lower. If the price increases, they buy less. The graph below shows how supply and demand come together to set the price of a good. This price is called the "equilibrium price" because it is the point at which supply and demand are equal. At this point, consumers are willing to buy exactly as much output as producers are willing to make. Several factors affect price-setting: • Competition: If there is only one supplier of a good, consumers have no choice. The supplier has more freedom to set a high price. If a supplier has no competition, it has a monopoly. • Substitute goods: If a good is one-of-a-kind, its value is higher. The supplier who has a unique good can charge more. But if consumers can· find a substitute for the good, then the good is no longer one-of-a-kind. As a result, the price of the good may fall. • Government action: Some goods are in limited supply. In a free market, the suppliers of those limited goods can increase the price to very high levels because demand will always be greater than supply. In these cases, the government may decide to put limits on the suppliers' ability to set prices. It may, for instance, establish prices.
