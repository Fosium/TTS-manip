One of the few journalists who disagreed with the accepted wisdom about Guatemala was an experienced Times reporter named Herbert Matthews, He had been with the paper since 1932, covering the Spanish Civil War and doing stints as bureau chief in Paris, Rome, London, and New Delhi. Since 1949, he had been an editorial writer specializing in Latin America, To be sure, his dissent over Arbenz was more one of11uance than of substance, After a fact-finding trip in 1952, his verdict was that Arbenz was "young, inexperienced, and enthusiastic," He and his colleagues were "naive enough to think that communism must take its part in any truly liberal regime, and they never could be made to realize the dangers of communism to their country and to themselves," Even as late as 1971, when he wrote his memoirs, Matthews made it clear that he had no qualms about the overthrow of Arbenz; he simply thought it could have been achieved less messily by helping the army and police to stage a coup. Matthews had followed events in Cuba closely for years. An increasingly despotic Batista had faced the threat of armed revolution since 1953, when a band of rebels led by Fidel Castro had attacked the Moncada barracks. After a brief spell in jail and then self-imposed exile, Castro had returned in 1956 aboard the yacht Granma to begin a guerrilla war in the mountains of the Sierra Maestra. His little army was soon encircled and cut off from the outside world. The United Press reported that he had been killed, and Batista's PR adviser, former CBS executive Edmund Chester, even gave the dictator the date of Fidel's death and burial-December 9, 1956. Out of the blue, however, in February 1957, Herbert Matthews received word from the Times's Havana stringer, Ruby Hart Philips, that Castro was alive and eager to give an interview. Matthews prepared his trip to the Sierra amidst the strictest secrecy. "The last place to get the slightest inkling of what was happening had to be the American embassy," he wrote. Relations between the Eisenhower administration and Batista had never been cosier. Until the late 1940s, diplomats in the region were often well informed scholars who took an active role in formulating policy. Dana Munro, U.S. charge d'affaires in Managua during the war against Sandino and author of a classic study of the five Central American republics, was a good example. But the U.S. ambassador in Havana, Arthur Gardner, was typical of a new breed of know-nothing political appointees who had come into the service after the Cold War purge of many career diplomats and were objects of contempt among their European counterparts. Gardner was ostentatiously close to Batista, and had even tried to persuade him that the FBI or CIA should dispatch a hit man into the Sierra to kill Castro. "Except for Cuban government circles and the American and Cuban business community," Matthews wrote, "Gardner was hated by the Cubans." Traveling south from Havana by car, Matthews took his wife along on the assignment for "camouflage" to get through military checkpoints, reasoning that in Cuba "nothing could have looked more innocent than a middle-aged couple of American tourists." He interviewed Castro on February 17, 1957, and the first of his three-part series hit the front page of the Times a week later. It caused a firestorm, and for years to come key phrases would be scrutinized to provide ammunition for those who blamed Matthews for "losing" Cuba. Castro emerged as a Jeffersonian figure, with ideas that were "radical, democratic, and therefore anti-Communist." He stressed that "we have no animosity toward the United States and the American people." The Cuban government was enraged most of all by Matthews's assessment (accurate, as it turned out) that "General Batista cannot possibly hope to suppress the Castro revolt." The regime accused Matthews of fabricating the entire story, to which the Times responded four days later by printing a photograph of Matthews conducting the interview while Castro lit one of his trademark cigars. It was, as Matthews himself said, "the biggest scoop of our times.‚Äù But much more than that, it was one of those rare moments when a single news story managed to cut through the haze of official untruth-whether the rigid censorship of Batista's police state or the drowsy complacency that had settled over America in Eisenhower's second term. It also opened a wound that has never healed, and could probably have been caused by no other country than this loose piece of Florida that had inexplicably come adrift ninety miles offshore. Paying attention to the realities of Cuba for the first time in -years, U.S. opinion created an instant drama of heroes and villains. With its decision to impose an arms embargo in March 1958, You can be sure we have no animosity toward the United States and the American people. ~ Castro to Matthews, 1957 536 the State Department served notice that Batista's days were numbered. Castro in turn became a folk hero, larger than life, Robin Hood to Batista's grotesque Sheriff of Nottingham. Hard on the heels of Matthews's reports came a CBS documentary titled Cuba's Jungle Fighters. Fidel, giving his second interview, stared into the camera lens and assured American viewers he was not a communist. In April 1959, three months after his triumphal entry into Havana, Castro came to the United States as the guest of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. The press lionized him: The CIA briefed him for two hours on the Red menace. The visit provoked one of Matthews's sharpest insights. "In reality," he wrote, "Americans were welcoming a figure who did not exist, expecting what could not and what would not happen, and then blaming Fidel Castro for their own blindness and ignorance." Castro soon made it apparent that while posing for photographs at the Lincoln Memorial was all very well, there were limits to how far he was willing to follow an American script. His militant brand of Cuban nationalism and the United States began to move, as in a law of physics, in opposing directions. This left Americans with two choices: accept the consequences of U.S.- Cuban history and assume responsibility for the past; or deny history, preserve innocence, and demand vengeance. As U.S.-Cuban relations careened from one crisis to another between 1959 and 1961, culminating in Castro's defiant embrace of the Soviet Union, the cry of betrayal filled the air. It searched for alien influences and fifth-columnists, and found scapegoats in State Department officials like Roy Rubottom ("He favored Castro, there is no question about it," former ambassador Gardner raged) and William Wieland of the Caribbean desk, who had lived in Cuba in the 1920s and 1930s. But the main target was Matthews, who became a lightning rod for the failure of the intelligence community to detect Castro's sympathies. (Even as late as 1959, after Castro had taken power, Allen Dulles assured the Senate that the Cuban leader did not have "any communist leanings.") The liberal Matthews found himself stigmatized as a fellow-traveler, a useful fool, and a traitor-insults that stuck to him until the end of his career. A cartoon in the archconservative National Review in May 1960, brilliantly parodying the Times's own advertising slogan, summed up the mood of rancor. By the time the cartoon appeared, the atmosphere was irretrievably poisoned. Conservatives like Spruille Braden, ambassador to Havana in the 1940s, thought Cuba was "the gravest threat there has ever been to the security of our country and the hemisphere." By March 1960, Eisenhower had decided that Washington could no longer coexist with Castro, and he authorized a program of covert actions to get rid of the Cuban leader. Over the next several years, the CIA would attempt to assassinate Castro with exploding cigars and poisoned milkshakes, and humiliate him with depilatory powders that would make his beard fall out. Americans heard a lot about Castro's iniquities, but nothing about the moves to topple him. At best, they read hopeful features that promised a return to traditional U.S.-Cuban friendship-one day. The March 1961 National Geographic carried a colorful report about life on the Guantanamo naval base, which one enthusiastic pilot thought was "kind of like Hawaii with Cubans." The reporter found guests at the Officers' Club sprawled in lawn chairs at one of eight open-air movie theaters, watching Vincente Minelli's new hit musical, Bells Are Ringing. The magazine catalogued the other 537 attractions of "Gitmo:': its neat cinder-block houses, seventeen softball fields, six baseball diamonds, four hobby shops, a darkroom, a roller-skating rink, and 'a twenty-seven-hole golf course. Some of the base wives, though, were less keen: "In fifteen minutes you can drive from one end of it to the other.... It's the same old thing day after day." The only real problem was the "anti-U.S. headlines of Cuban papers hawked at the gates." But to compensate for these, there were "repeated demonstrations-on a person-to-person level-of Cuban-American friendship." The best example was the annual Fourth of July baseball game between the base and a Cuban all-stars team. The navy had won the 1960 game 4-3 in extra innings. Otherwise the press was silent. In November 1960; the Nation reported that anti-Castro Cubans were being trained on a secret base in Guatemala, but the story died. The Miami papers knew from the talk on the streets that something big was in the air, but agreed with the CIA not to print the news. The New Republic and the New York Times killed or severely cut stories that detailed plans for an invasion of Cuba. In its January 13 issue, Time was still sneering at "Castro's continued tawdry little melodrama of invasion." So virulent was the dislike of Castro that no paper was willing to tip him off about the largest CIA operation in history, with as many as seven hundred agents holed up in an abandoned navy air base in the Miami suburb of Opa-Locka. The word from the White House-now occupied by John F. Kennedy, who had inherited Eisenhower's plans for Cuba-was that national security was at stake, and, as the Times's Theodore Bernstein explained, "Editors cannot have the information or specialized knowledge that would allow them to dispute an official determination that the 'country's safety might be jeopardized." On April 17, fourteen hundred men hit the Cuban beaches at the Bay of Pigs. Facing an army of thirty-five thousand, they were overwhelmed. It was, as Theodore Draper put it, "one of those rare politico-military events: a per-fect failure." Many called it the most humiliating defeat in American history. The humiliation was represented on so many stinging levels-from the image of undertrained, outnumbered troops stumbling ashore over coral reefs and swamps, to the bitter symbolism of defeat at the hands of a foreign leader cast as a virtual Antichrist. The fact that Cuba held a special place in U.S. history -San Juan Hill, the Maine, the Good Neighbor, the winter playground rubbed salt in the wounds. Just three months into his presidency, Kennedy was humiliated in all that he prized most: virile action, boldness in the defense of freedom. Those who accused Kennedy of betraying Brigade 2506 said the entire affair could have ended differently if he had ordered protective air strikes. The post- mortems in Washington, too, tended to emphasize the technical' aspects of the fiasco: rusty outboard motors, insufficient ammunition, bureaucratic snafus. Press comment also found the Bay of Pigs an embarrassment rather than an impropriety, and few papers condemned the principle of the invasion. No one saw that the seeds of the disaster could be found in its origins. "If the [CIA] had not had Guatemala, it probably would not have had Cuba," reflected E. Howard Hunt, who served in both operations. The Bay of Pigs and the overthrow of Arbenz employed the same team; the architect of both was CIA Deputy Director Richard Bissell. Agents assigned to the Cuba invasion initially called it Operation Guatemala. They used the same headquarters, the Opa-Locka base. The pilots flew from the same Nicaraguan airstrips. The men who engineered the downfall of Arbenz in 1954 were so intoxicated by their success that they thought it could be repeated-as if making foreign policy were like executing dance steps, following footprints painted on the floor. Bissell thought Castro would lose his nerve as Arbenz had, and failed to see any difference between the two men-in part, perhaps, because he came to believe the agency rhetoric that had depicted the moderate Arbenz as a flaming Red. The CIA saw history only as a useful guide to operational tactics, and never appreciated that the Cubans, too, might have studied the Guatemala episode and drawn entirely different lessons. As it happened, Castro's top lieutenant, Ernesto (Che) Guevara, had arrived in Guatemala in 1953 and had witnessed the entire affair. The first article he ever wrote was titled, "I Saw the Fall of Jacobo Arbenz." The Cubans had observed Arbenz's failure to secure his regime militarily and did not intend to repeat his mistake. The army was loyal to Castro, and the mass uprising on which the CIA had staked its hopes never took place. ' The Bay of Pigs sealed Castro's alignment with the Soviet Union and directly paved the way for the missile crisis the following year. While Castro was looking for a cast-iron guarantee against future invasions, Nikita Krushchev had observed Kennedy's refusal to send in U.S. troops to back up the invading brigade, and decided to test his opponent's strength. On October 14,1962, a U-2 spy plane flying over Cuba photographed a number of nuclear weapons launching sites at San Crist6bal. Kennedy ordered a naval blockade of Cuba, to prevent Soviet vessels that might be carrying missiles from reaching the island. For almost two 538 weeks the world appeared to stand on the brink of a nuclear exchange. In the end, Soviet ships turned back. "We're eyeball to eyeball" was the memorable comment of Secretary of State Dean Rusk, "and I think the other fellow just blinked." The crisis ended with an understanding that the Soviets would not station offensive weapons in Cuba; in return, the United States pledged not to invade the island. (In fact, as Dean Rusk revealed in 1987, Kennedy had been prepared to go the extra mile by linking the Cuba settlement to the removal of antiquated U.S. Jupiter missiles from Turkey.) Only after the missile crisis did the United States finally secure the release of the prisoners taken at the Bay of Pigs. The very idea of negotiating with Castro had aroused a storm of protest. "If the United States wants these men back," ran a typical May 1961 editorial in the Indianapolis Star, "let us simply go and take them." Eventually, the prisoners came back to Miami the week after Christmas 1962. Presidential aides advised Kennedy that a meeting with them would be a needlessly belligerent gesture. "But his brother Robert, the attorney general, who felt the United States had no higher priority in the world than overthrowing Castro, told him to go ahead. In a much-photographed welcome rally in Miami's Orange Bowl, accompanied by his wife, Jackie (who made a speech in Spanish), Kennedy committed the immense symbolic weight of the presidency to the Bay of Pigs veterans, telling them they represented America's highest values. The survivors of Brigade 2506 presented Kennedy with their banner, and he vowed, "This Hag will be returned to this brigade in free Havana." The Bay of Pigs and the missile crisis introduced a new and virulent theme to American politics, that of betrayal. Just as Washington had lambasted Castro for betraying the revolution, now the antiCastro exiles accused Kennedy of betraying them. The Bay of Pigs was the first time that the United States was accused of leaving its allies to twist in the wind because it was unwilling to put American lives on the line-a charge which returned to haunt Washington in Southeast Asia and can still be heard in debates over Central America. CubanAmericans, seeking a replay of the Bay of Pigs that they could win, began to make themselves felt in the mainstream of American politics, as well as the lunatic fringe. They were recruited as the Watergate burglars of Howard Hunt-of Guatemala fame-who told them they would find evidence of Castro's support for George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign. Veterans of the Bay of Pigs became key covert operatives and bureaucrats in the Southeast Asian war of the 1960s and 1970s, and in the contra war against Nicaragua a decade later. The trauma of the Bay of Pigs all but eclipsed a new program Kennedy had announced the previous month. The Alliance for Progress, which Kennedy called the most important foreign-policy initiative of his presidency, was a massive aid program, to be administered by the newly created Agency for International Development. The alliance was the second half of Kennedy's answer to the Cuban revolution, and its goal was to prove that the United States could offer a model of development and social welfare that would beat Castro on his own terms. The symbol of the enterprise was a handshake, wrapped in the Stars and Stripes. Also announced in March 1961 was the Peace Corps, perhaps the quintessential idea of the Kennedy era. It was to operate worldwide, but its roots, as the recruiting posters made clear, also lay in Cuba. At the Peace Corps Training Center in Puerto Rico, the closest available simulation of Third World conditions, new recruits were put through a three-month course in American institutions and values, the culture and language of the country to which they were assigned, and survival training. "If you impress the peoples of these countries with your commitment to freedom, to your pride in your country and its best traditions and what it stands for, the influence may be farreaching and will go far beyond the immediate dayto-day tasks that you may do in the months that are ahead.‚Äù
