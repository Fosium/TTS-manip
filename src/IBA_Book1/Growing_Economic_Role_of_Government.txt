During the New Deal and World War II, the federal government played a larger role in the American economy. New Deal programs cost money. Social Security payments added to government spending as well. The effect on the federal budget can be seen by looking at federal spending over the period. From 1925 until 1931, the federal government never spent more than $3.6 billion. In 1934 – as New Deal spending took effect – that number shot up to $6.7 billion. It continued to climb until it reached $9.6 billion in 1940. Conservative critics charged that President Franklin D. Roosevelt was trying to turn the U.S. into a socialist country. Newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst referred to "the Red New Deal with a Soviet seal endorsed with a Moscow hand." Government spending soared even higher during World War II because the government was buying armaments and paying millions of people in the armed forces. The government increased its spending in 1941 to $14 billion. By 1945, spending had skyrocketed to $95.2 billion. There were few complaints about this level of spending during the war – because the nation was fighting for its survival. With the New Deal and the war, the federal government played a growing role in the nation's economy. The government was bigger and had more workers. Even after the war ended, defense spending stayed high because of the Cold War. The true impact of the New Deal and the war on the role of the federal government is clear when looking at federal spending after the war. In 1946, spending began to drop, reaching a postwar low of $36.5 billion in 1948. This level was much lower than during World War II. Still, it was more than 10 times the amount spent before the New Deal. The government would never again be as small as it had been in the 1920s.
